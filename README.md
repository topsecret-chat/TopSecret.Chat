## Can I peer-review the Source Code?

All your communications are classified as `top-secret` and the _core-engine_'s Source Code is `top-secret` too, but you are free to inspect the _client-side_ Source Code that is naturally exposed to the users.
Peer-reviews are usually conducted on systems classified at most as secret, but not top-secret. 

We operate with a [Zero trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model) policy for total protection and we use __GitHub__ only as a public "Tracking System", so that users can report issues and follow up on release notes.
