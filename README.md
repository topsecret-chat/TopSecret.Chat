## Collaborate

Are you curious about helping?
Everybody can contribute with suggestions to improve the service and reporting bugs. For example, you can help us translating TopSecret Chat in your language.



## Can I peer-review the Source Code?

All your communications are classified as `top-secret` and our source-code too. The core-engine is kept secret and has a highly encrypted deployment to elude mass-surveillance programs world-wide.

However, we use some **Open-Source** code, maily for the client-side interface that is naturally exposed and available for you to freely inspect.

We operate with the [Zero trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model) security model for complete protection and we use [GitHub](https://github.com/topsecret-chat/topsecret-chat/issues) only as a public "_Issue Tracking System_" for users to report errors, suggestions and to follow up on the release notes.

For more information, please check out the main [Features](https://topsecret.chat/en/features/) on our website.
