## Can I review the Source Code?

As all your communications are classified as `top-secret`, also the core-engine's Source Code is `top-secret` too. 

We operate with a _zero-trust policy_ for total protection, working 24/7 to keep it that way!
We use __GitHub__ only as a public "Tracking System", so that users can report issues and follow up on release notes.

Exposing the Source Code to the public (aka `peer-review`), does not imply that vulnerabilities are actually reported in a timely manner, making the life easier to hackers and widening the risk of compromising your security and privacy. This is why peer-reviews are usually conducted on system classified (at most) as secret, but not top-secret. Ask yourself if a Security Agency or Defence Department would disclose the details of their top-secret technologies... simply not.
