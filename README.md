## Can I peer-review the Source Code?

All your communications are classified as `top-secret` and our source-code too. The core-engine is kept secret and deployed highly encrypted to elude mass-surveillance programs world-wide.

On the contrary, we use **Open-Source** code for the client-side interface that is naturally exposed and that you can freely inspect.

We operate with the [Zero trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model) security model for complete protection and we use [GitHub](https://github.com/topsecret-chat/topsecret-chat/issues) only as a public "Issue Tracking System" for users to report issues and to follow up on the release notes.

If you wish to know more unclassified information, please check out the [Features](https://topsecret.chat/en/features/) on our website.
