## Is it Open-Source?

TopSecret Chat's core-engine is a proprietary technology, not released under an Open-Source license.
The Android and iOS packages are signed for authenticity and the server-code is deployed encrypted to avoid tampering and elude mass-surveillance programs. 
If you choose the anonymous download of the [Android APK](https://topsecret.chat/en/platforms/) from our server, please verify the integrity of the the _SHA256 File Checksum_.

However, we also reference some [Open-Source](https://github.com/topsecret-chat) projects that are naturally exposed and available to the users for inspection.

## Donate

TopSecret Chat is funded and resourced by the `free` and `non-profit` collaboration of volunteers in the non-governmental organization [Bona Fide NGO](https://bonafide.ngo) that is engaged in social impact missions.
Donations are never linked to your TopSecret Chat account and can be anonymous.
